Project Overview
The telecommunications industry is losing customers at an alarming rate. To address this issue, we are using machine learning and data analysis to predict which customers are most likely to churn. This will allow us to proactively retain customers by identifying potential churners and taking targeted actions to keep them.

The project will use a variety of data sources, including customer history, usage patterns, and demographics. This data will be used to train machine learning models that can predict the likelihood of a customer churning. Once the models are trained, they will be used to identify potential churners. These customers will then be contacted and offered special incentives to stay with the company.

Project Objective
The main goal of this project is to develop machine learning models that can accurately predict customer churn. We will do this by analyzing historical customer data to identify patterns and factors that contribute to churn. This information will then be used by the telecom company to develop strategies to reduce churn rates. Specifically, we will use a variety of machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests. We will also use feature engineering techniques to improve the accuracy of the models. We believe that this project will be a valuable tool for the telecom company. It will help them to identify customers who are at risk of churning and take steps to prevent them from leaving. This will save the company money and improve customer satisfaction.
