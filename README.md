## Project Overview

The telecommunications industry is facing a significant challenge with the rapid loss of customers. To tackle this issue, we are employing machine learning and data analysis to predict customer churn. This approach enables us to proactively retain customers by identifying potential churners and taking targeted actions to retain them.

Our project utilizes various data sources, including customer history, usage patterns, and demographics. We leverage this data to train machine learning models capable of predicting customer churn likelihood. Once these models are trained, we deploy them to identify potential churners. Subsequently, these customers are contacted and offered special incentives to encourage them to remain with the company.

## Project Objective

Our primary project objective is to develop highly accurate machine learning models for predicting customer churn. We achieve this by analyzing historical customer data to uncover patterns and factors contributing to churn. The insights gained will enable the telecom company to devise strategies for reducing churn rates. Our approach encompasses a range of machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests. We also employ feature engineering techniques to enhance model accuracy. This project is expected to provide substantial value to the telecom company by helping identify at-risk customers and taking preventative measures, resulting in cost savings and improved customer satisfaction.
